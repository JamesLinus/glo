OpenGL Overload (*GLO*) aims at being a cross-platform implementation of OpenGL and building a streamline and modern APIs friendly OpenGL like API.

While Vulkan is a great explict graphics API, it's effortable only for a small part of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the multiplication of proprietary graphics APIs has fragmented the ecosystem.

Ideally this project will provide two front-ends: OpenGL and a modernized version OpenGL and multiple back-ends: Vulkan, Metal and DirectX12.

The amount of work needed is phenomenal, so let's see where it goes!
